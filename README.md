# Wind & Crops

You are having soil data. But, unaware about climate/weather effects on crops. This project helps someone (say a farmer) get details about weather specific crops. It gets location from user's device or makes them choose location from maps. Based on the geolocation: weather, population data and crops which can be grown are shown. Note: Population of places outside India won't show up; I had only Indian population data.
