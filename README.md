# Wind & Crops :umbrella:

You are having soil data. But, unaware about climate/weather effects on crops. This project helps someone (say a farmer) get details about weather specific crops. It gets location from user's device or makes them choose location from maps. Based on the geolocation: weather, population data and crops which can be grown are shown. Note: Population of places outside India won't show up; I had only Indian population data.

## Architecture :hourglass:

* Codeigniter
* AngularJS
* SPA
* REST based Communication
* JWT Authentication
* MySQL
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Maps APIs
* Openweathermap APIs
* jQuery Location Picker


etc.
